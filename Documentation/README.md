# Llandudno Junction

This is a small simulation representating the area around Llandudno Junction in North Wales, UK. The map includes junctions towards Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog and is indended as an easier simulation to operate.

## Simulation

The included timetables feature a full day of services, with starting points every 2 hours from 6am to 6pm. This allows you to start the simulation throughout the day.

### Tips

* A shuttle service operates between Llandudno and Llandudno Junction via Deganwy, these services should be routed into platform 2 at Llandudno Junction.

* It is recommended that services heading towards Colwyn Bay from Llandudno be routed to platform 1, with those originating in Holyhead be routed into platform 3.

* Conwy Valley Line trains from Llandudno/Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog should be routed into Platform 3 in order to be able to cross over towards Glan Conwy.

* Prioritise services to/from Holyhead and Chester.
